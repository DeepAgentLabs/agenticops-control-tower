# Lens optimization and Tower boundaries

## AgenticLens 0.11.0 optimization compatibility

AgenticLens 0.11.0 implements roadmap v0.9 Optimization Intelligence:
evidence-backed recommendations from recorded traces for prompts (caching,
compression), retrieval (top-k pruning, reranking), memory (summarization,
retention), tools (result caching, non-retryable errors), workflows (redundant
steps, handoffs that add no work) and models (quality-cost trade-offs between
variants). Projected benefit, confidence and quality risk stay separate; an
append-only ledger tracks accepted, rejected, adopted and reverted
recommendations; and adopted changes are evaluated against later traces, with
projected and observed outcomes side by side. Recommendations are advisory.
MCP 0.4.3 exposes read-only `lens.optimization_analyze` and pins hosted Lens
0.11.0. See the [optimization guide](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticlens/blob/v0.11.0/docs/optimization.md)
and [offline example](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/agenticlens/blob/v0.11.0/examples/optimization_demo.py).

The optional `agenticlens>=0.7,<1` range already admits 0.11.0 and the
development lock is unchanged. Tower does not ingest optimization reports, and
Lens ledger decisions are local files, not Tower approvals, rollouts or native
evidence. Fleet control and evidence posture remain Tower-owned. No runtime
change or Tower release is required.
